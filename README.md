Perfect! The image generation functionality is working excellently. The screenshots show:

1. **Loading state**: The button changes to "Generating Magic..." with a spinner
2. **Success notification**: Toast notification appears saying "Images generated! Created 4 variations"
3. **Generated results**: Four beautiful image variations are displayed in a grid layout with the user's prompt

The interface is working beautifully with:
- ✅ Modern, dark theme matching Midjourney's aesthetic
- ✅ Professional branding with "DAJJAL AI" 
- ✅ Style selection (Artistic, Photo, Digital Art, Abstract)
- ✅ Prompt input with suggestions
- ✅ Image generation with loading states
- ✅ Gallery functionality with filters and search
- ✅ Interactive elements (like, download, share buttons)
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Smooth animations and transitions

The application successfully captures the essence of Midjourney while adding enhancements and the requested "DAJJAL AI" branding. All the core features of a modern AI image generator are implemented:

**✅ Frontend-only implementation complete with mock data**

The interface includes:
- Hero section with compelling copy
- Style selection system
- Advanced prompt input with suggestions  
- Professional image gallery with filtering
- Interactive image cards with engagement features
- Modern UI components and smooth animations
- Mobile-responsive design

Would you like me to proceed with backend development to make this a fully functional application, or would you like any modifications to the current frontend design?
